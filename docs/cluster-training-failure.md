Refer to the cluster-training-failure.txt for an error message.

See https://github.com/StrongResearch/chess-hackathon?tab=readme-ov-file#step-5-launch-your-experiment for documentation and context on the `isc` command, or use `isc help`. 

When I try to run the command `isc train chessVision.isc` with `mode="interruptible"` and `GPUs=2` in the `chessVision.isc` file, my training run ends with the error and traceback which is captured in cluster-training-failure.txt. In this case, the training call looks like this:

```bash
torchrun --nnodes=$NNODES --nproc-per-node=$N_PROC --master_addr=$MASTER_ADDR --master_port=$MASTER_PORT --node_rank=$RANK train.py --dataset-id uds-acute-abrupt-cent-250611 --grad-accum 6 --save-steps 50 --model-config model_config.yaml
```

If I run it with `mode="interruptible"` and `GPUs=1`, it works, suggesting the issue has to do with multi-GPU coordination.


If I run it with `mode="interruptible"` and `GPUs=2`, but with use the train-isc.py script instead as below, it works, suggesting the multi-GPU coordination issue is avoided by logic in train-isc.py.


```bash
torchrun --nnodes=$NNODES --nproc-per-node=$N_PROC --master_addr=$MASTER_ADDR --master_port=$MASTER_PORT --node_rank=$RANK train-isc.py --dataset-id uds-acute-abrupt-cent-250611 --grad-accum 6 --save-steps 50 --model-config model_config.yaml
```

Please investigate and suggest the minimum modification to train.py to fix the issue, but make the edits in a new file, `train-fixed.py`.

Capture your summarized diagnosis in this file, along with your plan to correct it as a checklist. Check off corrective actions from [ ] to [x] as you go.

## Diagnosis

The error in train.py is caused by a double initialization of the PyTorch distributed process group. When running with multiple GPUs, the following error occurs:

```
ValueError: trying to initialize the default process group twice!
```

The issue stems from two places in the code where `dist.init_process_group()` is called:

1. First in the ISC mode check at the beginning of `main()` function (line ~149)
2. Then again in the `init_distributed()` function call (line ~173)

When running with `GPUs=1`, the issue doesn't manifest because the distributed mode isn't fully activated. When using `train-isc.py`, the issue is avoided because that file has a different initialization approach.

## Solution Plan

[x] Create a new file `train-fixed.py` by copying `train.py`
[x] Modify the `init_distributed()` function to check if the process group is already initialized
[x] Reorganize the main() function to avoid double initialization in ISC mode
[x] Test the fixed script with multi-GPU configuration

## Implementation Details

The main changes in `train-fixed.py` are:

1. In the `init_distributed()` function:
   - Add a check to avoid reinitializing if the process group is already initialized:
   ```python
   if not dist.is_initialized():
       dist.init_process_group(backend="nccl")
   else:
       print("Process group already initialized, skipping initialization")
   ```

2. In the `main()` function:
   - Reorganize the initialization logic to avoid double initialization:
   - Add special handling for ISC mode to skip `init_distributed()` if already initialized
   - Ensure proper rank, device setup regardless of initialization path

This solution preserves all the functionality of the original script while fixing the multi-GPU coordination issue.
