Refer to the cluster-training-failure.txt for an error message.

See https://github.com/StrongResearch/chess-hackathon?tab=readme-ov-file#step-5-launch-your-experiment for documentation and context on the `isc` command, or use `isc help`. 

When I try to run the command `isc train chessVision.isc` with `mode="interruptible"` and `GPUs=2` in the `chessVision.isc` file, my training run ends with the error and traceback which is captured in cluster-training-failure.txt. In this case, the training call looks like this:

```bash torchrun --nnodes=$NNODES --nproc-per-node=$N_PROC --master_addr=$MASTER_ADDR --master_port=$MASTER_PORT --node_rank=$RANK 
train.py --dataset-id uds-acute-abrupt-cent-250611 --grad-accum 6 --save-steps 50 --model-config model_config.yaml'''
```

If I run it with `mode="interruptible"` and `GPUs=1`, it works, suggesting the issue has to do with multi-GPU coordination.


If I run it with `mode="interruptible"` and `GPUs=2`, but with use the train-isc.py script instead as below, it works, suggesting the multi-GPU coordination issue is avoided by logic in train-isc.py.


```bash torchrun --nnodes=$NNODES --nproc-per-node=$N_PROC --master_addr=$MASTER_ADDR --master_port=$MASTER_PORT --node_rank=$RANK 
train-isc.py --dataset-id uds-acute-abrupt-cent-250611 --grad-accum 6 --save-steps 50 --model-config model_config.yaml'''
```

Please investigate and suggest the minimum modification to train.py to fix the issue, but make the edits in a new file, `train-fixed.py`.
